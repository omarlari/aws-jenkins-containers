:toc:

This reference architecture demonstrates how to leverage a single delivery pipeline to deploy to multiple orchestrators. This example will show how to simultanesouly deploy to both
ECS and Kubernetes. This demonstration could be used to deploy to hybrid scenario where you have Kubernetes on premises and ECS in the cloud. Alternatively it could also be use to deploy to
homogenous clusters in different regions.

=== Pre-Requisites

* Operational ECS Cluster
** An ECR Repository named 'hello'
** An ECS task definition named 'hello-jenkins'
** An ECS service named 'hello-jenkins'
*** this should be behind an ALB, listening on the root path on port 80

* Operation Kubernetes cluster
** config file located at ~/.kube/config
** deploy the sample deployment `deployment-hello.yaml` from the sample app repo `https://github.com/omarlari/aws-container-sample-app`

=== Deploy the CloudFormation stack

=== Prepare ec2 instance

Clone Repository

    git clone https://github.com/omarlari/aws-jenkins-containers.git

Create directory for jenkins data and kube config

    mkdir ~/jenkins-data
    mkdir ~/.kube

Build awscli and kubectl images

    cd aws-jenkins-containers
    docker build -f AWSCLI -t awscli .
    docker build -f KUBECTL -t kubectl .

SCP Kube credentials to instance

    scp ~/.kube/config ec2-user@<yourip>:~/.kube

Test awscli and kubectl

    docker run awscli s3 ls
    docker run -v /home/ec2-user/.kube:/config/.kube kubectl get nodes

Start Jenkins

    chmod u+x ~/aws-jenkins-containers/start-jenkins.sh
    sudo ~/aws-jenkins-containers/start-jenkins.sh

=== GitHub Preparation



Setup a Personal Access Token.

image::github-access-token.png[jenkins]

Log into GitHub “User X” account > Settings > Developer Setting > Personal access tokens > Generate new token. These are the minimum scopes you will need to support the Jenkins Webhook:

* repo
* admin:org
* admin:public_key
* admin:repo_hook

Copy the personal access token, we will need to copy this over to Jenkins credentials.

Fork the sample application:

https://github.com/omarlari/aws-container-sample-app

Next go to the forked repo. Click on Settings > Webhooks > Add webhook.

image::github-webhook.png[jenkins]

For the payload enter:

    http://<IPADDRESS>/github-webook

Where IP address is the public IP of your ec2 instance, the security group profile has already been setup to allow traffic from GitHub through cloudformation

Then click Add webhook.

Once this is completed you can go to the bottom of the screen and send a test payload.

=== Configure Jenkins

Once you have started the jenkins container launch a browser to the IP address of the ec2 instance, you will be presented with the following screen:

image::jenkins-getting-started.png[jenkins]

Retrieve the initial credentials from the jenkins container:

    docker ps
    docker exec -it <CONTAINER ID> bash
    cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    exit

Go ahead and copy and paste this into Jenkins to start the Jenkins configuration.

On the customize Jenkins screen, select "Install suggested plugins"

image::jenkins-customize.png[jenkins]

Next you will be prompted to create your first Jenkins user, if you want to avoid using the initial credentials go ahead and create an admin user:

image::jenkins-first-admin.png[jenkins]

You should be presented with this screen and we can finish the Jenkins configuration:

image::jenkins-ready.png[jenkins]

Next let's add the ECR plugin. On the left hand screen click 'Manage Jenkins' > 'Manage Plugins', on the 'Available' tab filter for 'Amazon ECR plugin' and install it.

This will install the following plugins:

* Amazon Web Services SDK
* CloudBees Amazon Web Service Credentials Plugin
* Amazon ECR plugin

Go ahead and click the check-box on the bottom to restart Jenkins and then log back in.

Next let's configure the credentials for GitHub.  One the left side of the Jenkins home screen click "Credentials" > "Global" > "Add Credentials",
add a credential with kind of "Secret text" and the "Secret" dialogue box paste in the Personal Access Token that we created in GitHub.

=== Configure Jenkins Job

Create a new job, from the home screen "New Item" > "Enter and item name" > "Pipeline" > "OK"

In the job configure the following:

* Check Discard old builds
* Max # of builds to keep = 5
* GitHub project = your forked repo
* This project is parameterized
** add the following string parameters and values that apply to your environment:
*** ECR_REPO
*** ECS_CLUSTER
*** APP = hello-jenkins
*** REGION
* Check GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
* Pipeline > Definition = Pipeline script from SCM
* SCM = Git
* Repositories URL = https://github.com/omarlari/aws-jenkins-containers
* Credentials = None
* Script Path = Jenkinsfile
